VISA App receives distance and haptic sensor data from SensorTile that acts as GATT server. Here is implementation of STLB100_GATT_client that connects to the server, reads its characteristcs' values and dispaches to appropriate consumer.

Implementation Background:

GATT client is implemented using Bleak framework. Bleak is a GATT client software, capable of connecting to BLE devices acting as GATT servers. It is designed to provide an asynchronous, cross-platform Python API to connect and communicate with e.g. sensors. 

Bleak documentation:

https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/bleak/stable/bleak.pdf

Requirenments to use STLB100_GATT_client:

1. Install Bluez 5.50 or newer

sudo apt install bluez

2. Install Bleak on Raspberry Pi 4 or your host platform for VISA App (tested platforms Raspberry Pi 4, Zero W armv6).

pip install bleak

3. Get familiar with bluetopthctl, gatttool, hciconfig, systemctl stop/start/restart  bluetooth

Current Functionality:

1. Connenct to the GATT server
2. Read servicess UUIDs, characteristics and descriptors.
3. Read environmental values

TODO:
1. Dispatch characterisitcs' values to a consumer
2. Test client against VISA SensorTile firmware. Add functionality to read distance sensor values in cantimeters.
3. Test client against VISA SensorTile firmware. Add functionality to write haptic feedback values to GATT server.
